# cwr_wildgrapes
update on the 2020 PNAS CWR of the USA workflow for new species

This is the base R workflow. See branch 'targets' for the targets based implementation of this modelling effort. 

As of 2023-06-23 neither of these methodologies are complete. 

## Goals 
1. revamp the existing CWR modeling methodology update libraries
2. replace absolute paths with a rproj file structure
3. provide more separation of the data cleaning, modeling, and gap analysis processes.
4. develop a more adaptive and flexible workflow that can be applied to additional species in the future
